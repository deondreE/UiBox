# UiBox

UiBox is heavily inspired by [Shadcn Ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion) from the web world. So Every component you see shared here, is also copyable straight from this website. We encourage the use of our components, but also easily provide the code for them, so you can customize as needed.

> Code implmentations can be found inside the details blocks.

> We are soon to support android for all of our components as well.
